# Executive IT Governance & Accountability Stabilization Portfolio

## Positioning

I work with mid-market organizations experiencing governance drift within their technology functions.

When KPIs exist but ownership is unclear, cloud costs rise without executive visibility, or boards question IT accountability, governance maturity has likely fallen behind operational complexity.

My role is to stabilize IT environments where accountability has eroded and restore decision clarity, cost transparency, and executive confidence.
